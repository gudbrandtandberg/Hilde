    I am an artist with two educations (animal doctor and artist), two countries of origin (USA and Norway),
    and infinite sources of inspiration and wonder. I admire animals and will seek to portray them playfully
    and respectfully in my paintings. Landscapes are a constant source of inspiration, with the sea and the
    wilderness of northern Norway at the heart of my work. People are the ultimate challenge, revealing not
    only the physical likeness, but also strength, warmth, laughter and character.

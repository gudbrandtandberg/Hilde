    <h3>The Portrait Process</h3>
    <p>
        The goal of each project is to deliver a personal portrait that embodies the spirit of
        the animal. I wish to start the project by talking to the owner about their horse or dog.
        Anecdotes from funny episodes or just everyday life with their animal companion are
        important in order to understand the animal’s character, and the dynamic between owner
        and dog/horse. Is this a cuddly pet, a serious work partner, a sporting companion, a
        combination, or something totally different?
    </p>
    <p>
        At this first meeting I also want to understand the owner’s expectations for the
        portrait. Do they want a totally naturalistic portrait, or would they like a colourful,
        more exaggerated expression? Head only or full body? The animal at work or at home,
        or with a neutral background? We can discuss examples and arrive at a concept to aim at.
        I say “aim at” because there is always an element of the unexpected in creating artwork.
    </p>
    <p>
        When we have a clear concept we can agree on a contract. To see a Contract template,
        follow <a href="images/diverse/contract_english.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: blue;">this</a> link.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the initial sketching I need to meet the dog or horse. I would like to see him/her in action
        together with the owner, and I also need some time alone with the animal. I draw pencil
        sketches and take reference photos for later use in the studio.
    </p>
    <p>
        I work on the final painting my studio. The owner will get frequent updates on progress,
        and can comment and ask for adjustments as the painting develops. I may need to come see
        the animal again during the process.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally the painting must dry for at least two weeks before delivery. The whole process,
        from first meeting to delivery of the painting takes about 2 months.
